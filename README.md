# Hubble-FITS-Images

Each Python code takes a corresponding FITS file and produces 3 images with various degrees of processing:
The left image is the raw telescope image with no processing, the middle is enhanced to make brighter regions brighter, the right image shows supresses the point-like sources (like stars) and enhances the remaining bright regions. All files are labeled by the celestial object imaged.


IMPORTANT:
While the Python codes are here, each one needs a corresponding FITS file. These files are too large to be stored here and instead all files are stored in a Google Drive folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PI9NQf2mq3rfbaNSu-WTjW8vMNJ9gbML?usp=sharing I highly recommend you download all files from there instead.


All FITS files are courtesy of the Hubble Legacy Archive at https://hla.stsci.edu/hlaview.html while the Python files are completely written by me.
