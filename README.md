# Hubble-FITS-Images

These Python programs take data captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (nasa.gov/hubble) and turns that data into images. This data from Hubble is stored in the form of a Flexible Image Transpot System (FITS) file. Inside this file is the information on where the telescope was pointed, how long it gathered data, and a table representing the picture it took. Each Python code outputs 3 images with different levels of processing: one image of just the raw image captured by Hubble, one with the brighter regions enhanced to show prominent features, and one where the point sources (like foreground stars) are filtered out.

IMPORTANT:
While the Python codes are here, each one needs a corresponding FITS file. These files are too large to be stored here and instead all files are stored in a Google Drive folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PI9NQf2mq3rfbaNSu-WTjW8vMNJ9gbML?usp=sharing I highly recommend you download all files from there instead.


All FITS files are courtesy of the Hubble Legacy Archive at https://hla.stsci.edu/hlaview.html while the Python files are completely written by me.
